### XML Parser
```
Write a program to parse an xml document.

The input program receives a string to the folder where the document is located.
You need to parse only one document - accordingly, provide various checks, for example, 
that there are no files in the folder, or there are several xml documents in the folder 
and other possible checks.

It is necessary to parse the xml document and write the contents of the 
line tags to another document. 
The file name for recording must consist of tag values and has the form:
<firstName>_<lastName>_<title>.txt
```
### Additionally
```
Additionally implement the following functionality:
if the value 1 is entered in the properties file - parse the document using SAX
if the value 2 is entered in the properties file - parse the document using DOM
```
